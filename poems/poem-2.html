            In the morning after the storm I will be waiting to give love to
            strangers,
            <br />
            On streets and neighbours, I did not know and when we meet again it
            will be
            <br />
            Like the first time, like we never met before,
            <br />
            Let's relive our youths once taken from us,
            <br />
            In ecstasy of not knowing what mistakes will make
            <br />
            But that this thing called life is ours for however long we have it
            <br />
            And if it is to be lived it is to be with love, courage and
            eagerness
            <br />
            Nothing is fixed or like it was and now is our opportunity to demand
            more.
            <br />
            More from the owners of property they wish to not share
            <br />
            More from each other when we are alone
            <br />
            For we all know trauma, and it’s shaking of our safety
            <br />
            Means fear is pointless for we have it all to gain
            <br />
            Life at its fullest
            <br />
            In its most colourful capacity
            <br />
            In which each version of humanity can exist as effervescently as
            they deserve
            <br />
            For life was almost lost but was it being lived before?
