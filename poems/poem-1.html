            Lets walls fall when you look <br />
            And says sometimes we have to play football in <br />
            No mans land before returning to the trenches <br />
            We can be on the same side <br />
            For as long as we want this to last <br />
            For hearts a gasp than time may have played <br />
            Games <br />
            But I look at you and say I am here at last <br />
            How long have you been waiting? <br />
            You say long enough to know what came before was worth it all
            <br />If finding a curiosity that will last a lifetime and adventure
            in the face of what once made you scared<br />
            Is the thing that makes me want to fall in love with you.
