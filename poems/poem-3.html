            I want to hold you, but I can’t <br />
            I don’t think I ever have not really<br />
            I don’t think we could <br />
            Cause when we learnt to hold ourselves before anyone else touched us
            <br />
            It's hard to be seen if your truth has so many layers <br />
            To pull away <br />
            I know whispers you aren't okay, and you know mine <br />
            But the world says we are clever and articulate <br />
            And we stand up and out and, in our truth, <br />
            But what if we never chose to stand out and the <br />
            Words we share so articulately aren't enough <br />
            Language to reach each other because language <br />
            Is only a mask the wise use to pretend we aren’t just like you
            <br />
            If you saw her the mornings she didn’t get up or <br />
            When fear encompassed maybe you’d know that <br />
            This is no power, but weakness shrouded by a false sense of<br />
            Security.<br />
            We make you feel safe to accommodate for the times we never did I
            hear whispers on phone calls that you aren’t okay <br />
            Fall for a bit but only to allow grazed knees <br />
            I can’t hold you right now
