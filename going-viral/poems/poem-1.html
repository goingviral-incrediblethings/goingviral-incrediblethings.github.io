              Let walls fall when you look <br />
              And says sometimes we have to play football in <br />
              No mans land before returning to the trenches <br />
              We can be on the same side <br />
              For as long as we want this to last <br />
              For hearts a gasp than time may have played <br />
              Games <br />
              But I look at you and say I am here at last <br />
              How long have you been waiting? <br />
              You say long enough to know what came before was worth it all
              <br />
              If finding a curiosity that will last a lifetime and adventure in
              the face of what once made you scared<br />
              Is the thing that makes me want to fall in love with you.
