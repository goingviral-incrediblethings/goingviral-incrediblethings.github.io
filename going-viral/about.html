            Going Viral is a collectively authored archive responding to COVID19
            and its effects on people's lives. It is an opportunity for
            audiences to respond and participate in an uncurated archive, that
            will exist as an alternative history for many years to come. We made
            this piece as it felt important to challenge the media's notion of
            one narrative and push for "We're all in this together". We are
            using various platforms across the Internet in which our audience
            can answer questions, respond with creative texts and engage with us
            the artists through feedback. This project does not have a time
            period and will last for as long as people choose to engage with it.
            Once the engagement lessens it will act as an archive for future
            generations to read and engage with all the many narratives this
            time has brought us.

            We believe the world that comes out of COVID-19 should be one that
            listens more closely to the desires and needs of its communities.
            This is our gift, an opportunity to create an online community that
            will build a collection of all the many stories us as people need to
            share with each other and the generations that come after us.
